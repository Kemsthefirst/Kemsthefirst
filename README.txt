 Hi dear, my name is Folakemi.
 I'm a Data Analyst.
 I'm a lover of books and good music
 I leverage Tableau and Power BI for visualization, utilize Power Query in Excel and Power BI for data preparation, and am expanding my proficiency in SQL and Python for increasingly comprehensive data querying, manipulation, and advanced analytics.
