Hi thereðŸ˜Š, my name is Folakemi.
I'm a Data Analyst.
In my free time i love to read books and listen to good music.
I use Tableau and Power BI for visualization, utilize Power Query in Excel and Power BI for data preparation, and I'm expanding my proficiency in SQL and Python for increasingly comprehensive data querying, manipulation, and advanced analytics.
I look forward to working on more projects that are impactful.
